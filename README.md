## _Metaverse of DAO-elected IP NFTs Incubation & Social_
Overeality incubates NFTs through a DAO-selection process, where everyone can participate in next-generation IP creation. Our community promotes and creates trending culture and lifestyle for the Metaverse by facilitating social networking through NFTs. 

We invite you to create, discover, and collect epochal NFTs designed for the next generation.

## Problems and Solutions
Current Problems:
- Centralized IP Creation Process: Community members have no power in the decision process and gain no profit out of the IPs they support.
- No NFT Incubator with Bottom-up Processing: New creators cannot effectively promote their NFTs or IPs.
- Limited NFT Cultures: The current NFT market focuses on monetary values way more than cultural values, lacking diverse NFT lifestyles.

Overeality's Solutions:
- Decentralized Blockchain for Fans Economy (FansFi): Create a decentralized economy where DAOs are able to make decisions on the IP creation process. Communities will have the power to choose what they want and the token holders will become decision-makers in such a process.
- Incubate NFTs through Community: We provide a platform where everyone will be able to launch their works which will be published to the community. We will further promote the selected NFTs through marketing, community interaction, and IP collaboration.
- Facilitates Formation of Diverse NFT Cultures: With people spending more and more time in the digital world, or even in the metaverse, we will boost the formation of cultural communities and facilitate the production of digital consumer goods by bringing in lifestyle signals and symbols into the society.
